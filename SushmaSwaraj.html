<h2>Sushma Swaraj</h2>
<p>In August, Twitter user Dev Tamboli posted a tweet directed to Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj.</p>
<p>He tweeted, "@SushmaSwaraj need help for rescuing my sister fm UAE. She went to UAE for job on 14th but now locked in a room pls contact me +97466893988.</p>
<p>Swaraj promptly replied, "I have asked our Ambassador in UAE to help. He will speak to you and do the needful. @Devtamboli."</p>
<p>As soon as the girl was rescued, Swaraj tweeted:We have rescued your sister with help of local Police. She is being moved to a shelter home run by Indian Embassy in Dubai.</p>
<p>Tamboli replied saying that the Dubai authorities had also begun probing the case. He thanked the Indian government and other social media organisations that stood by him at the time of distress.</p>
