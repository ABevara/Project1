<h2>Suresh Prabhu_helping a woman passenger</h2>
<p>On 26 November, a woman passenger travelling alone on an outstation train in Mumbai was quickly attended to by authorities after she sought help by tweeting to the @RailMinIndia, the Twitter handle of Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu.</p>
<p>She complained that a man in her coach was harassing her.</p>
<p>A senior officer took note of the tweet and responded to her request.</p>
<p>She was asked to contact the security helpline number 182, which she did eventually. She also gave out details of her position via Twitter. She was attended by RPF Jawans once the train reached Bhusaval railway station.</p>
<p>She later tweeted her thanks to the Railway Minister.</p>
